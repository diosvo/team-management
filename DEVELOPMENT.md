# Filename and Component name

For consistency, it's best to follow a clear naming convention. In React/Next.js projects, the most common and readable pattern is [Feature][Type] or [Entity][Action/Type].

If you want to apply this convention everywhere, always use [Entity][Type] (e.g., PlayerList, UserProfileCard, TeamStatsTable).

Use Filters (plural) for the component and filename:
Filters.tsx or filters.tsx
This matches common UI naming patterns (e.g., TableFilters, UserFilters).
