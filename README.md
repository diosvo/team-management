## Backend

Ensure that PostgresSQL (latest version) is running on your local machine, start it via Homebrew:

```bash
brew services start postgresql@17
```

View the databases directly in admin panels:

```bash
pnpm db:studio
```

Then open your browser at https://local.drizzle.studio/.

## Frontend

Install necessary npm packages:

```bash
pnpm install
```

And start the live server with the following script:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Then open your browser at http://localhost:3000/.
