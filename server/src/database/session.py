"""
Postgres Database Connection with SQLAlchemy:

- Engine (The most important component):
    - Responsible for connecting the "Pool" and "Dialect" to facilitate database connectivity and behavior.
    - Acts as the source of the database connection.

- Connection:
    - Provides high-level functionalities such as executing SQL statements, managing transactions, and retrieving results from the database.

- Session:
    - Represents a unit of work that groups related operations within a single transaction.

- Dialect:
    - A component that supports a specific database backend.
    - Serves as an intermediary between SQLAlchemy and the database, handling the details of communication.

- Connection Pool:
    - A mechanism that manages a collection of database connections.
    - Reuse existing connections rather than creating new ones for each request
